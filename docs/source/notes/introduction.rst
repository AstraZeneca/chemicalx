Introduction
=======================

ChemicalX is a deep learning library for drug-drug interaction, polypharmacy side effect, and synergy prediction. The library consists of data loaders and integrated benchmark datasets. It also includes state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures that solve the drug pair scoring task. Implemented methods cover traditional SMILES string based techniques and neural message passing based models.
